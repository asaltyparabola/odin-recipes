Odin Projects "Recipes" Project

April 20, 2022
This is my first website development project with the Basic HTML knowledge I have acquired though Odin Project's "Foundation" course. I will be building a basic recipe website within this repo.

This website will contain a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. Since I am unfamiliar with CSS while starting this project, it won't look very pretty.
