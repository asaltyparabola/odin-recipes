<h2>What are Churros?</h2>
    <p>Churros are a popular <em>Mexican</em> dessert that is quite popular in the US. They are made with simple choux pastry fried in hot oil and coated 
        in cinnamon sugar. Churros are a popular carnival or fair treat and let’s not forget Costco churros. We can’t get enough of their spongy 
        soft centers, crisp edges, and sweet coating.</p>

            <li>1/3 cup (75g) butter</li>

        </ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2> 
<h3>Cinnamon Sugar:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients in a small bowl. Reserve the sugar mixture in a container (⅓ pan) to coat the churro with the cinnamon sugar.</li>
    </ol>
<h3>Nutella Mexican Hot Chocolate Dip</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small pan, add heavy cream, cayenne, salt, cinnamon, espresso; heat that over medium heat until steamy hot but not boiling; next, 
            pour that hot mixture over the chocolate in a bowl. Shake it lightly and let it sit for two minutes until everything is melted.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Mix, keep it covered with plastic wrap in direct contact with the chocolate, and keep it warm. </li>
    </ol>    
<h3>Dough:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the beans from one vanilla bean, water, butter, sugar, salt, and almond extract in a small pot. Heat that mixture over medium-high 
            until the butter melts and the mixture begins to boil; then stir flour, mix it with a spatula and keep constantly stirring. </li>
            <br>
        <li>Once the dough is formed, smooth, thoroughly combined, and thickened, remove from heat, and allow to cool for seven minutes. 
            Next, transfer the dough to a bowl and begin beating it with electric beaters; then, add one whole egg; once combined, add 
            one more egg. </li>
            <br>
        <li>Place the proper tip in your piping bag, and fill it up with your dough. Shake out any air bubbles. </li> 
        <br>
        <li>Get a two-inch depth batch of fry oil in a pot, heat it to 350F. Pipe your churro dough into a straight stick on parchment 
            paper to your desired length, cut the dough with greased scissors; next, cut a border in the parchment around each churro. Pick 
            them up carefully, keeping them as straight as possible, gently lay them into the oil, and allow them to fry for a few seconds 
            before removing the parchment paper. </li>   
            <br>
        <li>Cook two to three churros at a time, let those fry, occasionally flipping until evenly golden brown and crisp on all sides about three 
            to five minutes. </li>  
            <br>
        <li>Remove from oil, place them on a paper towel, and toss immediately in the cinnamon sugar until thoroughly coated while they are 
            still hot. Repeat with all of your churros and serve hot and crispy.</li>
