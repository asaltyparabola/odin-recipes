<h2>What is a Burrito?</h2>    

<p>A <strong>burrito</strong> is a dish in Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine that took form in California cuisin, consisting of a flour tortilla 
    wrapped in a sealed cylindrical shape around various ingredients. The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, 
    making it more pliable, and allow it to adhere to itself. Burritos are often eaten by hand, as their tight wrapping keeps the ingredients 
    together. </p> 

<p>Burritos are filled with savory ingredients, most often a meat such as beef, chicken, or pork, and often include other ingredients, 
    such as rice, cooked beans (either whole or refried), vegetables, such as lettuce and tomatoes, cheese, and condiments such as salsa, pico 
    de gallo, guacamole, or crema.</p>
